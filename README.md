# Cosmic-distance-ladder-fits
This repository contains the files needed to make least-squares fit using information about the cosmic distance ladder method.

The data used are in the form of vectors in the folder "data-vectors", the theoretical equations of each model are in the form of matrices in the folder "equations-matrices" and the information about the covariance matrices for each case are in the folder "covariance-matrices".
