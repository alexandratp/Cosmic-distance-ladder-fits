These are the files needed to fit the data:

fit_r22.py: code to fit data with standardized apparent magnitudes of supernovae
fit_I.py: code to fit data with non-standardized apparent magnitudes of supernovae and standard color correction model
fit_II-III.py: code to fit data with non-standardized apparent magnitudes of supernovae and alternative color correction models
